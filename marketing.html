                 Here at Let’s Drink, we like to set SMART goals for ourselves. SMART stands for specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-sensitive. In doing so, we are able to fully concentrate on our goals, meet our deadlines, and strive to make our site the best it can be. Alongside creating a simple and user-friendly experience, our number one priority is to build awareness for our site and achieve a user base that continues to use the site to fulfill their needs over time. In terms of the number of visitors to our site, we want to have at least 100 visitors in the first few weeks. We believe that this is a realistic and achievable goal. With the help of Google Analytics, we are monitoring the traffic on our site to determine things like what people click on the most, what they search our site for, our most popular content, and aspects of the site we can improve. In this way, we are ensuring that our goals are met. If not, we will do what we can in order to do so.

            <div id="users">
                <p>The users of Let’s Drink are the people who like to have fun, think outside of the box, and want to drink. We offer people a way to find new drinks, new ways to use ingredients, and a new drinking experience. The people we envision using our service the most are beer and wine enthusiasts, Bars and clubs, and college students looking to broaden their alcoholic horizons.</p>

                <p>Beer and wine enthusiasts want a wide selection of options of drinks and an easy way to find and rank the different drinks. They want to be able to find new drinks that are similar to the ones that they already have tried and love. I believe the best way to market to our product to this persona is to reach out to a couple of wineries or drinking clubs to introduce the search service to them.</p>

                <p>Bars and clubs want to find cool different mixed drinks with precise directions about how to make them. They want the ability to find different drinks based on different unique holidays and what ingredients they have with them. I believe the best way to reach this community is to introduce the search service to new incoming bartenders while they are applying for their bartending license.</p>

                <p>College students want to find new drinks with the most kick, or the most wow factor, for the lowest price. They want a way to search by what ingredients they already have, and by popularity. The best way to reach this audience is using social media to get our product widely used through the Greek system and then the college as a whole.</p>
